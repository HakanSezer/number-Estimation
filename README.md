This application is included in the training video I watched on Udemy.

But I wrote 85% of the coding by myself.
The mistakes I have made;
- I wrote it as a downcasting string in prepare.
- I forgot the bool variable on the results page, so I couldn't open the losing screen, only the win screen was displayed.
